# NextJS Tutorial

# Assignment Brief: Understanding React & Introduction to NextJS

**Objective:** This assignment aims to acquaint you with React and NextJS, two integral tools used in modern web development.

## Part I - React

Begin by gaining a deeper understanding of React, its origins, and its purpose. A comprehensive documentary on the creation of React at Facebook has been made available to provide you valuable insights into React's inner workings and philosophy. This documentary is not just informative, but is also crucial to building your foundation in React.

## Part II - NextJS

Moving on, familiarize yourself with NextJS. Despite being based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NextJS is a powerful framework that has earned its place among the most popular and potent web application frameworks globally. Also known as server-side React, NextJS is an excellent stepping stone into the world of React. Don't let this intimidate you; instead, embrace the opportunity to explore its capabilities.

## Part III - Practice

After developing a conceptual understanding of React and NextJS, apply what you've learned in a practical exercise. For this part, you are required to complete a text-based tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the steps, from understanding NextJS to deploying your app.

Although the graded assignment via PlayWright will be posted later, feel free to begin working through the tutorial in advance. Once the assignment details are up, you can then clone your work into the given format.

In the following weeks, due to time constraints, detailed video instructions might not be available. Therefore, it is highly recommended to engage thoroughly with the text-based tutorial provided.

# Submision Guidelines

Complete through deploying your NextJS app to GitHub Pages, its better than GitHub Pages.  

Put a link to your site hosted on GitHHub pages [here](#)

Submit a link to your repository to Canvas when your code passes the Playwright tests.



# Install Instructions:
